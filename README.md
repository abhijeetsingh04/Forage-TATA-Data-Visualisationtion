# Forage TATA Data Visualisation

## Objective

 An online retail store is looking to analyze their data to uncover valuable insights that would be beneficial for the CEO and CMO. To achieve this, they need to formulate strategic questions that will yield the desired outcomes.


## Task

 Task 1:
 Framing the Business Scenario: This involved predicting the questions that business leaders, specifically the CMO and CEO, would seek answers to. I was tasked with formulating four insightful questions for each executive, covering both qualitative and quantitative dimensions.

 Task 2: 
 Selecting the Right Visuals: I participated in an assessment that required selecting the most appropriate visual representations in line with scenarios presented by the CEO and CMO.

 Task 3:
 Data Cleaning and Transformation: This stage involved refining the data by eliminating negative values, adding necessary columns, and ultimately analyzing and visualizing the cleaned data. The objective was to create visuals that effectively answered the questions posed by the CEO and CMO.

  Question 1
  The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.
 
  Question 2
  The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.
 
  Question 3
  The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.
 
  Question 4
  The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

 Task4: 
 Creating a Comprehensive Video Presentation: I produced a detailed video that showcased the entire process, from data cleaning to visualization, including a presentation of the final visuals.

## Dataset

Online Retail: The data for this analysis was sourced from the Forage platform.
The dataset comprises 541909 rows and 8 columns, which include: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID and Country. To extract more valuable insights, an additional column titled "Revenue" was created, bringing the total number of columns to 9.
